# AI-OWLS

Our long-term vision is to establish Rice University as a premier academic hub for practical, state-of-the-art, open-source algorithms for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) by directly applying the team's theories, practices, and methods with scientific applications in mind. This incentive is based on the fact that Rice Engineering School is a rare case where top-class academics from CS, ECE, Applied Math and Operations Research, and beyond interact actively within AI/ML, Optimization, Networks, and Decision Making. Yet, we often miss a shared vision and opportunity to jointly put ``flesh’’ into attempts toward practical algorithms with crucial societal impact.
